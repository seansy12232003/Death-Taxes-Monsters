## High Concept

In "Death, Taxes, & Monsters," players guide a brave peasant through a whimsical fantasy world on a mission to free his father, imprisoned for unpaid taxes. Battling unique monsters in turn-based combat, players collect unique gear and abilities from each foe they defeat while progressing through diverse environments and challenging bosses. The gameâ€™s theme highlights persistence and cleverness as the key to overcoming both monstrous creatures and life's bureaucratic obstacles.
