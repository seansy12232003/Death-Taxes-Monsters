## High Concept

In "Death, Taxes, & Monsters," players guide a brave peasant through a whimsical fantasy world on a mission to free his father, imprisoned for unpaid taxes. Battling unique monsters in turn-based combat, players collect unique gear and abilities from each foe they defeat while progressing through diverse environments and challenging bosses. The game’s theme highlights persistence and cleverness as the key to overcoming both monstrous creatures and life's bureaucratic obstacles.
